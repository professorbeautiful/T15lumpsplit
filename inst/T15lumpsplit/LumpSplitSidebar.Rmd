  Science splits and lumps.
**"splitting"**:
  things that seem the same turn out to be different.
That may prove to be useful.


Other advances proceed by **"lumping"**:
  identifying things that seem different
but have a deep connection.
That may prove to be useful.

  So, we split birds and bats, although they both fly.
But we lump bats and whales because they are both mammals.
(Or vice versa if studying modes of locomotion.)
And... a surprisingly cogent argument concludes that
[bats and whales.. and humans... are fish!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElpRJQ2FZiM)
And another, that [Fish Don't Exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Fish_Don%27t_Exist)
)

**In medicine** both splitting and lumping are important.

If you need information about some, say, medicine,
what's more important:
  * info about people **exactly like you**,
or
* info about **everybody**?

  Cancer was just "cancer" before it was learned
through clinical trials that some medicines work well on cancer
in one organ but not another---
  and vice versa for another medicine.

In recent years, however, specific molecular defects in cancer cells
have "lumped" together types of cancer
that we would not have dreamed of connecting.
The drug gleevec is a miracle drug
for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
But not for other leukemias.
Deep insight into molecular biology of cancer
showed that a radically different kind of cancer,
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST),
shares the molecular defect that makes gleevec work. Bingo!

  Better lumping together with
better splitting
can help patients, even cure some cancer patients.

AND... sometimes you don't have to choose.
You can do better than either.
