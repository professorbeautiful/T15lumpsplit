NOTES on deployment results and problems

2021-08-04
From branch 'master' I built
https://trials.shinyapps.io/Bias-variance-smoothing-shrinking-development/
And from branch '2019' I (re)built
https://trials.shinyapps.io/Bias-variance-smoothing-shrinking/


In Safari,
   DEVELOPMENT: the "advice" panels show, but TOC is out of place (overlapping) and the shinyjs chunk is showing output.
   For 2019, the TOC doesn't appear at all, and the browserAdvice and zoomAdvice appear in raw html.
In Chrome,
  DEVELOPMENT: the "advice" panels do NOT show when clicked, and control-D disconnects.
  For 2019,

In Safari, javascript console is alt-Cmd-c.-- but doesn't work; that's for the pastebuffer list.

I wonder if this "labelNode must be of length 1" error is worth fixing.  I think it's from shinyDebuggingPanel.

On Chrome, keeps crashing especially on interactions like clicking and typing,
and the contentsAdvice and DataEditingAdvice
do not appear on clicking the toggle
On Safari, the TOC is overlapping the app.
But the contentsAdvice and DataEditingAdvice are ok.
An entry box cookie persists,   "QA2=AHA%20for%20me!" , but the textarea does not fill.
