NOTES on deployment results and problems

2021-08-03
On Chrome, keeps crashing especially on interactions like clicking and typing,
and the contentsAdvice and DataEditingAdvice
do not appear on clicking the toggle
On Safari, the TOC is overlapping the app.
But the contentsAdvice and DataEditingAdvice are ok.
An entry box cookie persists,   "QA2=AHA%20for%20me!" , but the textarea does not fill.
