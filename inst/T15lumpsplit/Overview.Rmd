*"Bias, variance, smoothing, and shrinking"*  
We're going to begin with the *"lump versus split dilemma"* ,  
*The context*: a study treating patients and recording clinical responses.  
<b>The dilemma: </b> 
in making a good *"personalized medicine"* decision    
for one small group of patients,  
how should we use the data from patients in other larger groups (if at all)? 

Do we want low bias or low variance? Or, do we have to choose?  

This example gives us a jumping off point for individual explorations  
into a web of connected statistical topics important for data scientists.  
We examine both classical *"frequentist"* and *Bayesian* approaches.  
We touch on the role of prior information  
and the effects of having many additional features to split (classify) on.

Along the way, you get a few  questions to ponder,  
and to record  "Questions" and "Aha's"  
(observations, discoveries, delightful connections) that arise.  

Interested in technical details of derivations? 
or the coding?  
Some links are provided along the way.
